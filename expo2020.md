---

On Thursday 25 June, students of the Minor Makers Lab will present their projects on biomaterials, RIVM regulations, fashion, dating, packaging, exercise and DIY maker cultures. The students engaged in self-directed projects from home, making do with the limited tools and materials at hand. From their kitchens, gardens and bedrooms, our students engaged with challenges around the lived realities of the COVID-19 crisis, often combined with a strong sense of homebrewed material activism. 

### Join our guided tour on Thursday 25 June 4.00 PM via [this zoom link](https://bit.ly/makerexpo2020). 

## Minor Makers Lab: self-directed projects from home 
We arrive at the end of a semester that asked us all to reflectively engage with the conditions that make making as we know it possible. Repeatedly hitting our heads against our often invisible reliance on facilities and supply chains has been a struggle and a blessing, but seeing their interdependencies more clearly certainly encouraged us to take a radical turn in terms of the materials we choose to work with as makers. We experimented with bio-based materials and learned to embrace the fact that we would not be exerting the kind of control we are used to having over materials we know and work with when we use industrial machines. Limitations turned into openings and vice versa as we were practically confronted with the ways tools and staple materials inform what we can imagine.
