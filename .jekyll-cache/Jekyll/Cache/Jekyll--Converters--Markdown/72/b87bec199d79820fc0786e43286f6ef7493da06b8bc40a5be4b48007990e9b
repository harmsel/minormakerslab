I"ò<p>On Thursday 25 June, students of the Minor Makers Lab will present their projects on biomaterials, RIVM regulations, fashion, dating, packaging, exercise and DIY maker cultures. The students engaged in self-directed projects from home, making do with the limited tools and materials at hand. From their kitchens, gardens and bedrooms, our students engaged with challenges around the lived realities of the COVID-19 crisis, often combined with a strong sense of homebrewed material activism.</p>
