A few projects from the minor of 2022. This year, we partnered up with the Biodesign Challenge, an international competition and education program to support and shape the first generation of biodesigners. Our students explored the do’s, don’ts and dilemmas of designing with living organisms. 

Biodesign Challenge is an education program and competition that is shaping the first generation of biodesigners. BDC partners high school and university students with scientists, artists, and designers to envision, create, and critique transformational applications in biotech.

## A Hairy Issue

*The class selected this project team to represent AUAS at the Biodesign challenge and was one of the six finalists of the whole competition*

Not only 72 million kg of human hair are thrown aywa in Europe per year but also the valuable properties of hair are wasted. Can we discover the value of hair as a material? After experimenting with it, we decided to focus on hiar reinforced building materials to make use of its strength. And because it is our natural insulator, we developed hair as insulation ofr housing. This can be an alternative for less ecologically friendly insultation materials. Hair clippings are not waste, but a raw material waiting to be used. * Aaron Bibulovic​* Britt Vendel* Malika YunusCoach: Marjolijn Ruyg

## Edible Containers
With this project, students Anthony and Nathan want to reduce the plastic waste created in the process of selling food in single use containers at festivals. We developed a product for food vendors at Kwaku festival, by designing tempeh containers from lentil and soy beans. This well-loved ingredient is used in Surinamese dishes, so our edible containers will provide a new way of eating, without plastic waste. Eat me or yeet me!​* Anthony de la Fuente​* Nathan Stuger​​Coach: Marjolijn Ruyg

## Inkfinity: Rethink Colour​Inkfinity is a proposal for a brand that makes bacteria-based pigments, that can be  renewable, vegan and are produced without the use of harmful chemicals. Bacteria pigment can be produced locally and has potential to scale. Could bacteria help alleviate pressures on the supply chain of raw materials traditionally used for ink production, and reduce its impact on the environment? Together with artists, we rethink the future of colour.​* Mitchell Korver​* Melissa Liem​* Teunis Marseille​Coach: Yuri Westplat​

## WastedWe bring together two waste streams in the municipality of Baarn: we upcycled discarded cotton bedsheets from local hotels by dyeing them with food waste such as onion skins, and spent coffee from local coffee shops. From collecting the waste to dyeing, al of the steps in our production process are done in Baarn, making our products extremely local and perfect for locals who want a T-shirt that is sustainable and supports their community.​* Isa-Jane Ensing​* Josefien Matla​* Denise Mori​​Coach: Yuri Westplat​Partners: R-shirt and Boot

## Shroomextiles​We turn poor quality textiles that aren’t good enough resell or re-use, such as towels, underwear and socks into new material. Fibres are shredded and inoculated with reishi mushroom culture. The mycelium grows a network around the textile, forming a leather-like material with oil absorbing properties. We aim to turn this material into products and at the end of their lifecycle, they are collected and made into floating panels to absorb oils from oil spills.​* Lindsay Azzopardi​* Anne te Kulve​* Nick Vriend​Coach: Ista Boszhard​
