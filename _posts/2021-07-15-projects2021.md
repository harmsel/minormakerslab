A few projects from the minor of 2021. This year, we partnered up with the Biodesign Challenge, an international competition and education program to support and shape the first generation of biodesigners. Our students explored the do’s, don’ts and dilemmas of designing with living organisms. 

Biodesign Challenge is an education program and competition that is shaping the first generation of biodesigners. BDC partners high school and university students with scientists, artists, and designers to envision, create, and critique transformational applications in biotech. https://biodesignchallenge.org/

Here's the list of other competing schools in 2021: https://biodesignchallenge.org/2021-participating-schools

## Getting Our Shit Together

*The class selected this project team to represent AUAS at the Biodesign challenge*

In the Netherlands there is an abundance of cattle, that produces overwhelming quantities of dung. On top of that, the huge nitrogen emission of the Dutch agricultural industry puts a halt on construction of houses during the current housing shortage. What to do with all this poo? In search for a solution we tried to optimize cow manure into 3D printable paste, with the final goal of 3D printing inhabitablemanure houses.​Doris Hondtong​Maxim Meijer​Miruna Vlad​Coach: Marjolijn Ruyg

## Edible Containers
With this project, students Anthony and Nathan want to reduce the plastic waste created in the process of selling food in single use containers at festivals. We developed a product for food vendors at Kwaku festival, by designing tempeh containers from lentil and soy beans. This well-loved ingredient is used in Surinamese dishes, so our edible containers will provide a new way of eating, without plastic waste. Eat me or yeet me!​Anthony de la Fuente​Nathan Stuger​​Coach: Marjolijn Ruyg

## Inkfinity: Rethink Colour​Inkfinity is a proposal for a brand that makes bacteria-based pigments, that can be  renewable, vegan and are produced without the use of harmful chemicals. Bacteria pigment can be produced locally and has potential to scale. Could bacteria help alleviate pressures on the supply chain of raw materials traditionally used for ink production, and reduce its impact on the environment? Together with artists, we rethink the future of colour.​Mitchell Korver​Melissa Liem​Teunis Marseille​Coach: Yuri Westplat​

## WastedWe bring together two waste streams in the municipality of Baarn: we upcycled discarded cotton bedsheets from local hotels by dyeing them with food waste such as onion skins, and spent coffee from local coffee shops. From collecting the waste to dyeing, al of the steps in our production process are done in Baarn, making our products extremely local and perfect for locals who want a T-shirt that is sustainable and supports their community.​Isa-Jane Ensing​Josefien Matla​Denise Mori​​Coach: Yuri Westplat​Partners: R-shirt and Boot

## Shroomextiles​We turn poor quality textiles that aren’t good enough resell or re-use, such as towels, underwear and socks into new material. Fibres are shredded and inoculated with reishi mushroom culture. The mycelium grows a network around the textile, forming a leather-like material with oil absorbing properties. We aim to turn this material into products and at the end of their lifecycle, they are collected and made into floating panels to absorb oils from oil spills.​Lindsay Azzopardi​Anne te Kulve​Nick Vriend​Coach: Ista Boszhard​
